            <h1>about me...</h1>
            <div class="about-me">
                <p>Hello!</p>
                <br>
                <p>My name is Joe Micucci, and I'm a tech professional based out of Indianapolis, IN whose</p> 
                <p>expertise lies primarily in client-facing support, service, and success roles.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I spent the first decade of my working career in any, and all, facets of customer service & support. You name it, I've heard someone complain about it.</p>
                <p>That all changed back in September of 2021 when I enrolled at Eleven Fifty Acadamey and took part in their Software Development Course.</p>
                <p>I ended up graduating in December of that same year, and started my journey in tech, a field that I'm genuinely passionate about.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Through my coding bootcamp, I learned that while I enjoyed having the technical knowledge of a coder,</p> 
                <p>I still enjoyed the human interraction part of working for a company. This led to me getting into the world of</p>
                <p>customer success, which has allowed me to combine my client skills with my technical skills to be an expert liaison</p>
                <p>between clients and the internal technical teams I have worked with since graduating.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One of my largest passions outside of work is basketball, and the best way I would describe myself in the work place is a team-oriented</p> 
                <p>point guard that is a facilitator on the court making sure those I am playing with are able to get to their spots. That way, when</p> 
                <p>the ball gets in their hands, it's in an advantageous situation. Thus, allowing us all to thrive together.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I appreciate you taking the time to check out my portfolio, and look forward to teaming up with you!</p>
